This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
**BUT** this is an extend for [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) that means you <u>should be already use</u> [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to ~build~ **extend** your own component libraries._
